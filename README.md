# Chrome Data Copier

## 📌 About This Project  
This script is a simple tool that finds the **Login Data** and **Local State** files of **Google Chrome** and copies them to the same location where the script is executed.

---

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. Run the **`copy_chrome_data.bat`** file in any location you prefer.  
2. After execution, two files will be copied to the same directory:
   - `Local State`
   - `Login Data`
3. If the process is successful, you will see a **✅ success message**.  
4. If an error occurs, a **❌ copy error message** will be displayed.

## 📂 Project Files  
- **`copy_chrome_data.bat`** → The main script to copy Chrome data files.  
- **`README.md`** → A guide on how to use the script.  

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes  
- This script only checks the **default Chrome directory**. If Chrome is installed in a custom location, you need to edit the paths in the script.  
- If the target files are **missing**, Chrome may not have stored any login data, or the paths might be different.  
- To **avoid permission issues**, run the script with **Administrator privileges (Run as Administrator)**.  

---

## 🛠 Support  
If you encounter any issues using this script, you can modify the **`.bat`** file and adjust the paths to fit your needs.
